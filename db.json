The targeted diet was developed with respect to a safe operating space for food systems within planetary boundaries and promoting dietary and food production practices to ensure that the UN Sustainable Development Goals relating to hunger, health, and environment are achieved. Their reference diet presents a substantial shift from current diets, requiring a greater than 50% decrease in unhealthy foods such as red meat, sugar, starchy roots and refined grains and a greater than 100% increase in consumption of healthy foods such as nuts, fruits, vegetables and legumes, which will require changes in current food production patterns."

This journal is what I turn to when I sit down to start writing my articles. It is filled with words, sentences and letters, most of them written in a barely decryptable handwriting. I use it to write down the addresses and names of the restaurants and hotels I’m visiting. And the time schedules for trains or names of traditional meals, straight forward stuff. But all of those facts are available online, for you and everyone else."
